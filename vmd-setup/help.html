    <h3>How to get a password for downloading VMD source archive?</h3>
    <p>
      Your can register yourself at the <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD">VMD official website</a>.  Please select an archve, and you will be requested to fulfill the registration form.  Note that once registration has been finished.  You can close the web browser (you don't need to wait until the archive has been downloaded), since vmd-setup script will downloads an appropriate archive by itself.
